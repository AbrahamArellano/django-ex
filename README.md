# Openshift quickstart: CertBot

This is a [CertBot](http://www.CertBotproject.com) project that you can use as the starting point to develop your own and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

The steps in this document assume that you have access to an OpenShift deployment that you can deploy applications on.

## What has been done for you

A Cron Job that check the certificates in the existing Routes in the Openshift namespace using a Python Dynamic client.

## Special files in this repository


```
openshift/         - OpenShift-specific files
├── scripts        - helper scripts
└── templates      - application templates


```

## Warnings

Please be sure to read the following warnings and considerations before running this code on your local workstation, shared systems, or production environments.

### Automatic test execution

The Cron Job will be triggered every 3 minutes and will print all available certificates from Routes.

## Local development

Use the script:

```
openshift_client_no_container/         - Python scripts
└── dynamic_openshift_client.py        - Dynamic python client


```


## Deploying to OpenShift

Use the following command to deploy/execute the Certificate Bot in Openshift:

oc new-app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbrahamArellano/django-ex/master/openshift/templates/certificate_watchdog_cronjob.json -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/AbrahamArellano/django-ex -p NAME=[APPLICATION_NAME] -p NAMESPACE=[OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE] -p DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PORT=[REGISTRY_SERVER_IP]:[REGISTRY_SERVER_PORT]

## Special environment variables

###NAMESPACE:
Define the Openshift namespace name where the installation is done

###DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PORT: 
Define the docker registry server and port using the following syntax [SERVER]:[PORT]. Is relevant to mention that those values should be provided by the cluster administrator or checking the description of the image after it is deployed in the namespace.
